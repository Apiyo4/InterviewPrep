"""
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list of its branch sums (ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum). A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch. A Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node. Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.
