Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first
instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return
'_'.
Example
For s = "abacabad", the output should be
first_not_repeating_character(s) = 'c'.
There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c
since it appears in the string first.
For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
first_not_repeating_character(s) = '_'.
There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.
